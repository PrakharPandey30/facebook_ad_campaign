# Analyzing Facebook Ad Campaign Performance

This project involves analyzing the performance of a Facebook ad campaign using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The analysis includes the creation of important key performance indicators (KPIs), optimization of ad spend, and the use of data visualization techniques to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

* Create important KPIs such as Click Through Rate, Rate of Ad Spend, Cost Per Conversion, and Cost Per Click to understand the impact of different customer groups on the return on ad spend (ROAS).
* Optimize the cost of the organization by analyzing the impact of various ad campaign features on ROAS.
* Visualize the findings using Seaborn and Matplotlib to help communicate the insights gained from the analysis.
